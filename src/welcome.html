            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The BRIDGE consortium has been established as an organisational umbrella for NIHR BioResource funded Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)
                projects which aim (i) to discover sequence variants underlying hitherto unresolved inherited Rare Diseases or (ii) to evaluate the sensitivity
                and specificity of exome sequencing or other NGS approaches to identify already known high penetrance Rare Disease-causing variants.
            </p>
            <P>
                If you are a clinician or a patient and would like to receive further information about the BRIDGE studies please e-mail rarediseases@nihrbioresource.org.uk
                A Memorandum of Understanding outlining the principles of collaboration underpinning BRIDGE studies is available upon request.
